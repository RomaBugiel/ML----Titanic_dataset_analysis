# Titanic Kaggle Dataset analysis

A well known beginner level Titanic Data set analysis. 
Score on Kaggle: 0.78

## Technical - general

### Programming Languages
* Python: Widely used for its simplicity and extensive libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBooster)
* SQL

### Environments 
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Revision Control: Git

### Data Manipulation and Cleaning
* Data manipulation: missing values handling by model training and predicting, mean value
* Feature engenering: creating new features like isMarried, Desk, Room, FamilySize

### Data Visualization
* Matplotlib and Seaborn (histograms, correlation plots, count plots)

## Data Science Workflow  
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Selecting and training models.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using appropriate metrics.
6. Deployment: Implementing the model in a production environment.
7. Feature importance testing: feature importance and feauture permutation.

## Technical - Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
* Classification models: Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, Logistic Regression 
* Gradient Booster: XGBooster

## Model Evaluation and Selection
* Cross-validation techniques: K-Fold Cross-Validation.
* Metrics: Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC.
* Hyperparameter tuning: Grid Search
